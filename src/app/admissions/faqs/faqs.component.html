           <p>No school can guarantee you employment immediately after training. We teach you the technical skills
             youâ€™ll need in the music industry, immerse you in a professional working environment, and give you access
             to industry contacts to network with. More importantly, you start off from day one with your foot in the
             door of a professional recording studio. If you can prove yourself indispensable to their operation during
             your training, there's a very high tendency they will hire you.</p>
